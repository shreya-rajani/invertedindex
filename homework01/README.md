For this homework assignment, you will create a solution for Project Euler Problem #6 (Links to an external site.). This problem states:

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 â€“ 385 = 2640. Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
