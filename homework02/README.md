Homework 02: Argument Parser
Due Sep 5, 2013 by 11:59pm  Points 10  Available after Aug 30, 2013 at 12am
Summary
For this homework assignment, create a class ArgumentParser that stores flag and value pairs in a map. Once complete, you'll end up using this class in all of your future projects!

In this context, a flag is any non-null text that starts with a "-" dash and is followed by at least one symbol. For example, in -a apple the text -a is a valid flag. A value is optional text that follows a flag, and may not be null, empty, or start with the "-" symbol. For example, in -a apple the text apple is a valid value.
