Due Oct 17, 2013 by 8:59pm  Points 10  Available after Oct 11, 2013 at 2pm
Summary
For this homework assignment, create a class MultiReaderLock that allows simultaneous read operations, but disallows simultaneous write and read/write operations.

You will use this class in project 3.

Getting Started

Download the files located on at:

https://github.com/cs212/homework/tree/master/MultiReaderLock (Links to an external site.)
Fill in the missing code. If you are uncertain what a particular method should do, refer to the JavaDoc comments. Use the jUnit tests provided to test functionality. You may add members and methods to the MultiReaderLock.java file, but you may not modify the method signatures already present. This means you may not make a provided method throw an exception if it was not already.

DO NOT MODIFY THE TEST CODE. You may NOT modify the function declarations in the template code. This includes adding the throws keyword to throw exceptions.

Submission
Submit your work to SVN using Eclipse at https://www.cs.usfca.edu/svn/username/cs212/homework04 where username is your USF Connect username.
