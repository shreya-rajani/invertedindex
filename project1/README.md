CS 212 Projects
===============

You can find input files, expected output files, and JUnit test cases for all the projects in this repository.

Getting Started
---------------

Place the <code>input</code>, <code>output</code>, and <code>tests</code> directories in your root project directory in Eclipse. Right-click the <code>tests</code> directory in Eclipse, and under "Build Path" select the "Use as Source Folder" option.

To run the JUnit tests, open the appropriate <code>Project#Tester.java</code> file (where <code>#</code> is the project number) in Eclipse and from the "Run" menu select the "Run As" submenu, and select the "JUnit Test" option.

Note: You will not pass all of the tests until you run your code on a lab computer. You can do this remotely. See the course website for more information.
