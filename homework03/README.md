Homework 03: Word Counter
Due Sep 19, 2013 by 11:59pm  Points 10  Available after Sep 13, 2013 at 12am
Summary
For this homework assignment, create a class WordCounter that parses a file, and counts the words within that file. Your code must use the new java.nio.file.* package for all file input and output. The parsing done in this will be very similar to your first project!

Getting Started

Download the files located on at:

https://github.com/cs212/homework/tree/master/WordCounter (Links to an external site.)
Fill in the missing code. If you are uncertain what a particular method should do, refer to the provided JavaDoc documentation. Use the jUnit tests provided to test functionality. You may add members and methods to the WordCounter.java file, but you may not modify the method signatures already present. This means you may not make a provided method throw an exception if it was not already.

DO NOT MODIFY THE TEST CODE. You may NOT modify the function declarations in the template code. This includes adding the throws keyword to throw exceptions.

Submission
Submit your work to SVN using Eclipse at https://www.cs.usfca.edu/svn/username/cs212/homework03 (Links to an external site.) where username is your USF Connect username.

If you are using Eclipse properly, then you should have the following files (at a minimum):

Note: You must both pass all of the provided unit tests and pass a cursory code review by the teacher assistant to receive full credit on this homework assignment.
