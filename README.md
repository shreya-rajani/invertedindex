Learning Outcomes
At the end of this course, students should be able to:

Independently design software programs approximately 2,000 lines of code in size
Produce professional-quality code and documentation
Redesign and refactor code to improve efficiency, maintainability, etc.
Use logging and software testing to identify and repair software bugs
Assessment of these outcomes will be done by a combination of quizzes, exams, homework, projects, and code review.

Course Requirements
This course occasionally have a flipped classroom. Videos, to be watched outside of class, will replace traditional lectures. Class time will then be used primarily for exercises, quizzes, and completing homework. The benefit of this approach are re-watchable video lectures, and more time working on problems while the instructor is present to help.

Additionally, this course utilizes mastery learning and interactive code review. You must master each project before moving on to the next project. Mastery of functionality will be enforced via testing scripts, and mastery of code design will be enforced via interactive code reviews.

You are expected to spend between 15 to 20 hours per week minimum outside of class.

Homework

A combination of homework exercises will be assigned in class. You will be given class time to work on these exercises, and will be able to get help completing the exercises from the instructor. If you do not finish these exercises in class, you will need to complete them on your own time.

Quizzes

Quizzes will be given at the start of most classes to verify students are watching the assigned videos and keeping up with the course content. Students will be given a fixed amount of time at the start of class to complete the quiz, and the quizzes must be completed in class (not from home).

Projects

Project assignments place an emphasis on code quality—it is not enough to achieve correct results. Each project will undergo a rigorous code review checking for specific criteria, such as proper encapsulation and generalization, efficiency, and maintainability. You may not move on to the next project until (a) the project produces correct output, and (b) the project passes the code review process.

As such, the project grade will depend on the number of projects completed by each student. The exact grade for each project depends on the submission process. Each student receives one opportunity per project to fix and resubmit the project. Additional resubmissions will result in a point deduction.

Additional details on each project and the project submission process will be posted on the course website.

Exams

There will be two exams: a midterm and final exam. The final exam is not comprehensive, and will be held during the last week of class.

Finals week will be reserved for interactive project grading. A signup sheet will be posted towards the end of the semester. If you have travel plans during finals week, please confirm your travel dates first with the instructor.

Grade Breakdown
The final grade for this course will depend on a mix of homework, quizzes, projects, and exams. The specific breakdown is as follows:

15% 	Homework and Quizzes
15% 	Project 1 Inverted Index
15% 	Project 2 Partial Search
15% 	Project 3 Multithreading
10% 	Project 4 Web Crawler
10% 	Project 5 Search Engine
10% 	Midterm Exam
10% 	Final Exam
Letter grades will be assigned according to the following scale:

A+	 ≥ 	97%
A	 ≥ 	94%
A–	 ≥ 	90%
B+	 ≥ 	87%
B	 ≥ 	84%
B–	 ≥ 	80%
C+	 ≥ 	77%
C	 ≥ 	74%
C–	 ≥ 	70%
D+	 ≥ 	67%
D	 ≥ 	64%
D–	 ≥ 	60%
F	 < 	60%
For example, you will receive a C letter grade if your grade is greater than or equal to 70% and less than 77%. Please note this scale is subject to change. See http://www.usfca.edu/catalog/regulations/student/#497495 (Links to an external site.) for more information about letter grades and how they are translated into GPA.

Attendance Policy
Students are expected to be on-time to all classes. Attendance is mandatory for all exams, quizzes, labs, and exercises. Exam dates will be posted on the course calendar.

Late Policy
All deadlines and exam dates are firm. No late homework or quizzes will be accepted. All projects, except the final project, may be submitted (or resubmitted) up to the cutoff date. The final project will be submitted at interactive grading during finals week.

Exceptions to this policy are made only in the case of verifiable medical or family emergency. Extensions and makeup exams must be arranged PRIOR to the original deadline unless in case of extreme emergency (such as an emergency room visit).

Academic Honesty
All students are expected to know and adhere to the University of San Francisco's Honor Code. Go to http://www.usfca.edu/catalog/policies/honor (Links to an external site.) for details. The first violation of the Honor Code will result in an automatic 0 on the offending assignment, and repeat violations will result in an automatic F for the course.

Simply put, do not cheat and do not plagiarize. This includes copying code from the web, copying code from other students, working too closely with other students (all work in this class must be done individually), or having anyone other than yourself write your code.

We will be running MOSS on code to detect cheating in class. See http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/ (Links to an external site.) for more information.

Student Support
The CS Tutoring Center (CSTC) provides peer tutoring services and workshops for lower-division computer science courses, including CS 212 Software Development. See http://tutoringcenter.cs.usfca.edu/ (Links to an external site.) for more details.

The Learning and Writing Center (LWC) provides writing assistance to students in their academic pursuits. Services are free to students and include individual and group tutoring appointments and consultations to develop specific study strategies and approaches. Please visit http://www.usfca.edu/lwc for more information.

The Center for Academic and Student Achievement (CASA) provides students academic and personal support to promote holistic student development. Please visit http://usfca.edu/casa/ for more information.

The Student Disability Services (SDS) provides support for students with disabilities. If you are a student with a disability or disabling condition, or if you think you may have a disability, please contact SDS within the first week of class to speak with a disability specialist. If you are determined eligible for reasonable accommodations, your disability specialist will send your accommodation letter to the instructor detailing your needs for the course. Please visit http://www.usfca.edu/sds for more information.
